I am currently a scientist at [New York Stuctural Biology Center][nysbc], where I provide cryo-EM services, consultation, and training to academic scientists from NYC and across the US.

My research interests are in structural biology, cryo-EM automation, sample preparation, understanding how macromolecular complexes work, and big data.

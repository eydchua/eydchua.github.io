# Research Interests
Structural biology, cryo-EM, sample preparation, automation, molecular complexes, big data

<br>

# Research Experience
**Scientist, [Simons Electron Microscopy Center][semc], [New York Stuctural Biology Center][nysbc], 2020-present**
<br>
`Research highlight`<br>
<img align="right" src="/assets/vitrocam.png">{: width="150" }
With a focus on improving automation and efficiency in cryo-EM sample preparation, we built the [Vitrocam][vitrocam], a simple and cost-effective Raspberry Pi camera, to image grids in the Vitrobot during plunging. This device can greatly shorten the sample preparation feedback loop by providing information on grid and ice quality during plunge freezing, instead of costly and time-consuming screening in an electron microscope.

`Access and Training`<br>
I pioneered the [grid preparation and screening][gps] program at our NIH-funded National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training (NCCAT). Through this program, users with limited cryo-EM access or expertise can gain access and training to prepare their samples for high resolution cryo-EM imaging.

`Skills`<br>
Single particle cryo-EM training and consultation, microscope operations, sample preparation and optimization for cryo-EM, Python and Jupyter lab

**Research Associate, [Wigley Lab][wigley], Imperial College London, 2018-2020**
<br>
`Biological system`<br>

We studied SWR1, a yeast chromatin remodeling complex involved in histone exchange. Through ATP catalysis, SWR1 removes the canonical H2A-H2B histone dimer from the nucleosome and replaces it with the Htz-H2B variant dimer.

`Impact`<br>
We determined the [first high resolution structure of SWR1 by cryo-EM][swr1]. This revealed the molecular architecture of SWR1 and the first steps of SWR1 binding to the nucleosome. In collaboration with single molecule biophysicists, we described the dynamics in nucleosomal DNA during SWR1 binding and histone exchange.

`Tools`<br>
Single particle cryo-EM, fluorescence-based enzyme kinetics, microscale thermophoresis, electromobility shift assay, insect cell culture and Multibac cloning, protein expression and purification

<br>
`Impact`<br>
<img align="right" src="/assets/vpp-nucleosome.png">{: width="150" }
We applied the [Volta phase plate to single particle cryo-EM][vpp] to show that imaging DNA and reconstructing small 200 kDa nucleosome particles was possible.

`Tools`<br>
Single particle cryo-EM, Vola phase plate, mammalian cell culture

<br>
**Doctoral Research, [Davey lab][davey], Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 2010-2014**<br>
`Biological system`<br>
<img align="right" src="/assets/dna-footprinting.png">{: width="150" }
We studied the structures and functions of nucleosomes, the basic repeating unit of chromatin. Nucleosomes are responsible for compacting, organizing, and providing access to DNA in eukaryotic cells.

`Impact`<br>
We designed and characterized [novel platinum-based agents that target unique DNA structural motifs in the nucleosome][platinum], furthering our ability to design cancer-specific DNA-binding molecules. Our work on nucleosomes reconstituted with the strongly-positioning Widom 601 sequence provided insight into the [mechanisms underpinning DNA binding to the histone octamer][601].

`Skills`<br>
X-ray crystallography, DNA footprinting, tyrosine fluorescence quenching, surface plasmon resonance, bacterial cell culture and cloning
